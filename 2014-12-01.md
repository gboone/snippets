Last week:
- Merged what felt like a million pull requests for 18f.gsa.gov, thanks
  @eric, @elainekamlley and everyone else who weighed in on them.
- Submitted a couple of those million pull requests
- Helped @eric and @robertlread publish a new blog post
- Worked on some high priority bugs in the 18f-site issues list
- Refined and offered feedback to Peace Corps on their donation portal
  content drafts
- Ate a lot of pie, mashed potatoes, and chicken (not turkey) after hours

This week:
- Eating leftover pie, mashed potatoes, and chicken after hours
- Diving into user research with @elainekamlley on 18f.gsa.gov to drive a
  near-future site redesign
- Work more with Peace Corps on their donation portal drafts
- Welcoming more awesome new hires to the 18F team!
